Curriculum Developer Intern — Assignment 
Timeline: Take-home assignment (24 hours)
What you submit: 1) GitHub repo link, 2) Lesson plan PDF link

1) Take-Home Assignment (24 hours)
Project: Kid-safe Text-Mood Detector (Streamlit + TextBlob or rule-based)
Create a simple web app that takes a short sentence and returns a kid-friendly emoji (😀 😐 😞) with a one-line explanation. It should be suitable for students aged 12–16.

Core requirements
• Tech: Python 3.9+ with Streamlit, and TextBlob (or small rule-based approach — no heavy models).
• Features:
  - Input box for a sentence.
  - Output: emoji + short explanation (e.g., “Sounds happy!”).
  - Neutral fallback for unknown or inappropriate text.
  - Optional “Teacher Mode” to show a simple diagram of how the app works.
• Safety: Filter bad words; keep all messages age-appropriate.

  ├─ README.md          # how to run + learning notes
  └─ lesson_plan.pdf    # lesson plan for ages 12–16

Keep it minimal and clean — avoid large datasets or complex folders.
